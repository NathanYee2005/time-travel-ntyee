I learned how to manage my github repository in a effective and polished manner. I did make a mistake where I made a bad commit, so I had to resolve it by clearing the bad commit with the command "git reset â€“hard HEAD". I made another mistake where I had several typos in my branch name when creating it, so I had to resolve it by deleting the bad branch with the command "git branch -D fat/Layuot" before remaking the branch with the proper name.
